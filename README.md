# Tetris Game Implementation

This repository contains my custom implementation of the popular game Tetris. The goal of this project is to create a fully functional game that adheres to all the guidelines and rules of the original game.

## Installation

TODO: Add installation instructions

## Controls

The controls for the game are as follows:

- Left Arrow Key: Move the falling block left
- Right Arrow Key: Move the falling block right
- Down Arrow Key: Move the falling block down faster
- Up Arrow Key: Rotate the falling block
- Spacebar: Drop the falling block to the bottom

## Game Rules

The game follows the basic rules of Tetris. The player controls falling blocks of various shapes, and must rotate and move them to fit together with the blocks already on the game board. When the player completes a row of blocks, it is cleared, and the player receives points. The game ends when the player is no longer able to fit the falling blocks onto the game board without creating a gap.
